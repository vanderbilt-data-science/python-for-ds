    "Welcome to the DSI workshops on learning Python and command-line git!  In the following two workshops, you'll learn the basics of Python programming and also explore packages for data science with Python.  This notebook contains all of the preflight videos you'll watch before coming to the workshops as well as what we'll cover during the workshops."

    "In these workshops, we'll jointly look at Python basics and Python packages for data science.  We'll cover python basics including basic data types and data structures and functions.  We'll also see how the grammar of data manipulation looks for Python in terms of `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange`, and `summarise`; additionally, we'll look at `groupby`s and performing joins.  \n",
