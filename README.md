> Learning the grammar of data manipulation in Python

Welcome to the DSI workshops on learning Python for data science skills!  In the following two workshops, you'll learn the basics of Python programming for data analysis with Python.  Please click the above link to open the any notebook in Colab.  

# Getting the most out of the workshop
This is a hands-on workshop and we're excited to code together with you!  Please follow along _and code along_ with us to get the most out of the workshop.  This workshop uses Colab as a coding platform, so all you need is a gmail address and a computer with internet access to participate!  Don't worry about installing any software locally unless you simply want to.  If you fall behind or get lost during the workshops, please feel free to directly use the solutions (filename ends with `-solns`) associated with the notebook we're currently exploring together.  For virtual workshops, make sure to unmute and ask/answer questions, or also feel free to ask and answer questions using the chat function.

We'll be focusing on analytical data tasks using pandas, and we'll practice manipulating data using dataframes so that you'll be able to load and use tabular data that you have after the workshop.  We will not cover basic Python data structures in depth, but several notebooks are provided for you to review to learn more about python basics, basic data structures in Pandas, and basic manipulation of other pandas datatypes.  We encourage you to review and try out these notebooks to learn more about data analysis.

# Topics
